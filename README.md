# PolyFEM UI

Due to the greatly changed design of the UI interface, 
and the complexity of modular design that the previous UI has grown into,
it would be more difficult to try to understand the previous code base and
reshape it. 

Rather it would be much easier to start afresh and use the previously gathered
experiences in shaping the modular design of this UI. The development can
be greatly sped up by reusing the past visual/functional components that
are stand-alone and functionally complete.
